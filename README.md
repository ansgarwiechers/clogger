What is this?
=============
The `CLogger` class serves as an abstraction layer for logging in VBScripts. That
way a script can define the logging facilities once and then use the same set
of functions for writing log messages to all selected facilities. Supported
facilities are:

- interactive console/desktop
- log file
- eventlog

By default, console logging is enabled when the script is run interactively
(`WScript.Interactive = True`), otherwise the default is logging to eventlog.
When console logging is enabled and the script is run with the cscript.exe
interpreter, log messages are written to `StdOut` or `StdErr`, depending on their
log level. When the script is run with the `wscript.exe` interpreter, console
log messages are displayed as `MsgBox()` pop-ups instead.

The class does not do any error handling by itself. All errors MUST be handled
by the parent script.

Including the class
===================
To use the class in your scripts you must either copy/paste it to the script,
or use this neat import procedure:

    ' <http://gazeek.com/coding/importing-vbs-files-in-your-vbscript-project/>
    Sub Import(ByVal filename)
    	Dim fso, sh, file, code

    	Set fso = CreateObject("Scripting.FileSystemObject")
    	Set sh = CreateObject("WScript.Shell")
    	filename = sh.ExpandEnvironmentStrings(filename)
    	filename = fso.GetAbsolutePathName(filename)
    	Set file = fso.OpenTextFile(filename)
    	code = file.ReadAll
    	file.Close
    	ExecuteGlobal(code)
    End Sub


Example
=======

    ' creating a new CLogger instance
    Set myLogger = New CLogger

    ' configuring the logger
    myLogger.Debug = True               ' enable debug logging
    myLogger.LogToConsole = False       ' disable logging to console
    myLogger.LogToEventlog = True       ' enable logging to eventlog
    myLogger.Overwrite = True           ' overwrite log file (default is to append)
                                        ' This property must be set before the log
                                        ' file is opened. It's ignored by all other
                                        ' facilities.
    myLogger.LogFile = "C:\my.log"      ' enable logging to file C:\my.log

    ' logging stuff
    myLogger.LogInfo "foo"              ' log information level message
    myLogger.Log "foo2"                 ' alias for LogInfo()
    myLogger.LogError "bar"             ' log error message
    myLogger.LogDebug "baz"             ' log debug message (if Debug is set to
                                        ' True, otherwise these messages are
                                        ' discarded)
